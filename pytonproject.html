      <li>The programming language that is shown in this video is python 2.7.10
      The purpose of the program is to use all of the python coding language 
      knowledge we know in order to create a simple game and the purpose is 
      also to be able to play tic tac toe on python. The video illustrates how
      the code works when two players play two different games of tic tac toe,
      one game illustrates a player win and the second game illustrates a tie.
      The first game illustrates both players playing and at the end player x
      gets three in a row and when that happens the message “player x wins!”.
      The game is then restarted and the two players proceed with the second
      game, eventually the game ends in a tie and the program displays “Tie!”
      when neither player x or o wins.

      <li>The incremental and iterative process that i use to solve errors
      is first finding where the problem in the code is, this is done by 
      placincing print statements every few lines of code and when the program
      is run the last print statement to be displayed shows where the error in
      the code is happening, and if a statement is not printing that could be 
      because the lines of code before that did not function properly. Once the
      problem in the code was found decide what the line of code should be doing,
      is it supposed to be remembering something? Is it supposed to be a loop that
      has to only run if a condition is met? Is it supposed to use player input?
     
      Once you decide what the line of code is intended to do try the associated
      commands, for example to remember something create a variable/list. For
      creating a loop use a while statement and for player input use raw_input()
      in order to allow the player to put their own input in. Specifically in our
      own code we had to figure out how we were going to keep track of which 
      players turn it was, first we decided to just alternate the turns between
      players, everytime the board was printed the players turn would switch. 
      We decided this would not work because if the player chose a spot that was
      already taken it would move on to the next players turn without allowing 
      the player to do their proper turn. Through the iterative process we decided
      the code needed to remember which players turn it was, we decided to create
      a variable called count that whenever the tic tac toe board was printed the
      count would go up by one and when the count was divisible by 2 it was player
      o’s turn and when they put a wrong input the board would print again and
      take 1 away from count. This solved our problem of deciding whose turn it
      was.
