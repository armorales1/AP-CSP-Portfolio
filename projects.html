       <p>          
      <li>My program is a puzzle game based on trying to escape a room
      by finding clues, codes, and keys. I wrote this game using an online
      interface using the scratch development environment to write this 
      code. The purpose of my program is to challenge the player mentally
      by making them search for clues and decipher patterns that could 
      then be turned into codes that would ultimately let you escape the 
      room that you are trapped in. the video illustrates mechanics such 
      as detecting specific items in an inventory system that allows the 
      player to interact with objects, this is exemplified by the necessity 
      of the screwdriver in the inventory in order to take the painting off 
      of the wall and expose a key. The game also shows a mouse tracking 
      feature that allows the user to drag a box when the mouse button is 
      held down and drop the box when the mouse button is released.</li>

      <li>There were several difficulties i encountered while working on
      this project. One of the first major problems i had encountered was
      a sprite kept duplicating itself. In the game when a painting on
      the wall is clicked the painting proceeds to fall and expose a
      key that was hidden behind, the player could then collect one of
      the two keys needed to escape the room, but the problem was that
      the painting could be clicked again and a new key would spawn. 
      Through using this exploit the player could collect infinite keys 
      that would allow them to escape the room. The first solution that 
      i thought to try was to make another sprite in front of the key so
      the player could not collect more keys, but his was a problem because
      the sprite would cover up the initial key that the player needed to 
      proceed. So the solution was not as simple as I initially anticipated.
      Instead of covering the key i then thought why not make it so the key 
      would only spawn if there was not a key already in the players 
      inventory. So i made the game constantly check for a key in the players
      inventory and if there was a key in there the key sprite would be 
      hidden but if there was no key in the inventory the key sprite 
      would appear.\
